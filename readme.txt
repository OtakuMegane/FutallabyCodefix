Based on GazouBBS and Futaba

** Codefix Version **

Version 040103 is ancient (PHP 4 era) and completely broken on modern PHP and MySQL. Codefix is an update which does the bare minimum to get it working again on modern systems. No new features or functional improvements have been done.

This is meant to let people experiment with the original software that 4chan's Yotsuba and some other imageboard software started from. The code base is still ancient and should not be used for anything production.
